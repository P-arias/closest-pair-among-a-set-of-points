# closest-pair-among-a-set-of-points
The program consist of a single file that computes the closest pair among a
set of points.
Input is read from the terminal as a series of lines. The first line will contain a single
integer n, indicating the number of points in the input set. Following this, the input contains
exactly n more lines, each containing two, space-separated real numbers denoting the x and y
coordinates of one point in the input set.
Output is written to the terminal as a pair of points. Each point is printed on its own
line, as two, space-separated real numbers.
